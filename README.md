# Covid-Data
This dataset contains covid data up till mid 2021, with a record of deaths, vaccinations, infection count etc.
This is an EDA on the covid pandemic done in SQL.
This is the [Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/Coviddashboard_16560980100010/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) on the analysis.
Any feedback would be appreciated Thanks.
